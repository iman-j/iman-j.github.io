						Github portfolio by Iman Jizan
						<hr>
					</h4>
					<p>This GitHub portfolio is a compilation of personal projects and notebooks which I have developed and created over the years.
						The notebook projects are strongly focused on data analysis and/or exploration of machine learning algorithms.

							A data analytics dashboard built using Django and Plotly Dash. I started this project before the new and what seems to be a fully complete framework <a href="https://github.com/GibbsConsulting/django-plotly-dash">django-plotly-dash</a> came into play. This was a challenging project as Django and Plotly Dash are independent applications that run on their own server.
							My approach to the solution was to allow the Dash app run within the Django rendered page. This allowed Django to handle all routing and data models while also being able to pass context to the Dash app via the url.

							As they always say, project-based learning is an excellent way to learn new knowledge or obtain a new skill. I used this project to learn c# and web development. Looking back at the project now, I realise this was a big undertaking for a beginner. It started with learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and then c# and the ASP.NET Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to bring it all together.

							Popular Clustering Algorithms in R and Python Running One Notebook
						</h5>
						<p>
							<i>GitHub Page:</i> <strong><a href="https://github.com/iman-j/machine-learning/blob/master/r-and-python-in-jupyter/Popular%20Clustering%20Algorithms%20in%20Python%20and%20R%20-%20Combined.ipynb">Notebook</a></strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							As you may know, clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. In this notebook, I demonstrate the ease of use of R and Python when creating the three most popular clustering algorithms - K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSAN). To be able to compare R and Python clustering, this notebook demonstrates how to run R and Python in one Jypyter notebook. This is currently work in progress.

							Archibald Prize Analysis

						</p>
						<p>
							The Archibald Prize is an Australian award that is annually awarded to the best portrait. In this notebook, the Python library <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> was used to web scrape the Archibaled Prize web pages for all the information of each artworks for the last 97 years. It is a personally interesting data analysis investigation, and is currently a work in progress.
